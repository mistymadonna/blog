I binge-watched the original Unsolved Mysteries (with Robert Stack), and here are the best things I learned from watching the entire series in ~8 months.

This sketchnote features repeated cases with the highest frequency. For example, criminals who plan to escape jail work to get a reputation for “model behavior” and getting a job outside so they can escape. They’re always the “model prisoner.”

Specific themes stuck out like the numerous amnesia cases where people remembered the city of San Diego and were skilled with computers and flying a plane.

Multiple criminal occurrences of the same cities came up, and that was a little unsettling.

Most of the fraud schemes were somewhat similar in detail, even though they were different cases in different parts of the country.
